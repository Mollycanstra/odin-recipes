    <p></p><h4><u>Ingredients</u></h4></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup almond milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup rolled oats</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon chia seeds</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon maple syrup + more for topping</li>
            <li>Fruit of your choice for topping</li>    
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Add the almond milk, rolled oats, chia seeds, almond butter, and maple syrup directly into  your mason jar. Using a spoon, mix until the milk has incorporated evenly with the oat mixture.</li>
            <li>Press down with your spoon to ensure all the oats and seeds are moistened and are immersed in the almond milk. </li>
            <li>Cover with the jar lid and refrigerate overnight or at least 6 hours until the oats have been evenly rehydrated. </li>
            <li>When ready to serve, top with your choice of seasonal fruit followed by more maple syrup if you wish. The oats will last for 2-3 days in your refrigerator. Keep the fruit separate to extend shelf life. </li>
